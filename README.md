I started off this project because I felt that the economy sustained by financial advisors and property agents are not for value creation, but performing the roles of middlemen. However, the industry is set up for this as the regulations of finance-related tech implementations require a financial license. As such, the issue here stems from a policy perspective rather than a tech perspective. As such, I am putting a pause to the project to ideate on more ideas.
